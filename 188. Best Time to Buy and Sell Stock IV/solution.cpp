/** 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Credits:Special thanks to @Freezen for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
